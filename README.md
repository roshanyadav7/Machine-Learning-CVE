# Algorithms Used

The project compares five classification algorithms.

## 1. CatBoost

CatBoost is a gradient-boosting algorithm based on decision trees.

```python
CatBoostClassifier(
    iterations=100,
    depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    verbose=0,
    random_state=0
)
```

---

## 2. AdaBoost

AdaBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners to create a stronger classifier.

```python
AdaBoostClassifier(
    random_state=0
)
```

---

## 3. K-Nearest Neighbors

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifies a sample based on the classes of its nearest neighboring samples.

```python
KNeighborsClassifier(
    n_neighbors=5,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

---

## 4. Gaussian Naive Bayes

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem.

```python
GaussianNB()
```

---

## 5. Support Vector Machine

The project uses a linear Support Vector Machine through `LinearSVC`.

```python
LinearSVC(
    C=1.0,
    max_iter=5000,
    random_state=0
)
```

`LinearSVC` is used instead of the general `SVC` implementation because the dataset contains a large number of samples.

---

# Dataset

The project uses network traffic data from the **CICIDS2017 dataset**.

The main experiment uses the following three files:

```text
Tuesday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv
Wednesday-workingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv
Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.pcap_ISCX.csv
```

The datasets contain network traffic features and a target class representing different types of network activity.

The combined dataset used during development contains approximately:

```text
1.3 million rows
78 features
11 target classes
```

## Target Classes

The target classes include:

```text
BENIGN
DoS GoldenEye
DoS Hulk
DoS Slowhttptest
DoS slowloris
FTP-Patator
Heartbleed
SSH-Patator
Web Attack – Brute Force
Web Attack – Sql Injection
Web Attack – XSS
```

> **Note:** The original CSV datasets are very large and are not included in this GitHub repository. Place the required CSV files inside the `datasets/` directory before running the program.

---

# Data Preprocessing

Several preprocessing steps are performed automatically.

## 1. Combine Datasets

Multiple CSV files are loaded and combined using Pandas:

```python
pd.concat()
```

---

## 2. Clean Column Names

Whitespace is removed from column names:

```python
dataset.columns = dataset.columns.str.strip()
```

---

## 3. Separate Features and Target

The last column is used as the target variable:

```python
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1]
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1]
```

---

## 4. Convert Features to Numeric

Non-numeric values are converted to missing values:

```python
X = X.apply(
    pd.to_numeric,
    errors="coerce"
)
```

---

## 5. Handle Infinite Values

Positive and negative infinity values are replaced with `NaN`:

```python
X.replace(
    [np.inf, -np.inf],
    np.nan,
    inplace=True
)
```

---

## 6. Handle Missing Values

Missing values are replaced using the mean of each feature:

```python
SimpleImputer(
    strategy="mean"
)
```

---

## 7. Encode Target Labels

Categorical target labels are converted into numerical values using:

```python
LabelEncoder()
```

For example:

```text
BENIGN       → 0
DoS GoldenEye → 1
DoS Hulk     → 2
...
```

---

# Stratified Sampling

The original combined dataset contains approximately 1.3 million samples.

Running 75 experiments on the complete dataset can require a large amount of computational time, especially for algorithms such as KNN and SVM.

Therefore, the program uses a stratified sample:

```python
MAX_EXPERIMENT_ROWS = 20000
```

The sample is selected while approximately preserving the original class distribution.

```python
train_test_split(
    np.arange(X.shape[0]),
    train_size=MAX_EXPERIMENT_ROWS,
    random_state=0,
    stratify=y
)
```

This allows the experiments to use up to **20,000 samples** while maintaining class representation.

---

# PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction.

The experiment tests five PCA configurations:

```python
PCA_COMPONENTS = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Therefore, each algorithm is tested with:

```text
2 PCA components
4 PCA components
6 PCA components
8 PCA components
10 PCA components
```

PCA is fitted only on the training data and then applied to the test data:

```python
X_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train_original)

X_test = pca.transform(X_test_original)
```

This prevents the test data from being used when fitting PCA.

---

# Test Sizes

Three different test sizes are evaluated:

```python
TEST_SIZES = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
```

| Test Size | Training Data | Testing Data |
| --------: | ------------: | -----------: |
|       20% |           80% |          20% |
|       40% |           60% |          40% |
|       60% |           40% |          60% |

All train-test splits use stratification:

```python
stratify=y
```

---

# Experiment Structure

The experiment contains:

```text
5 Algorithms
×
3 Test Sizes
×
5 PCA Configurations
=
75 Experiments
```

### Calculation

```text
5 × 3 × 5 = 75
```

The program automatically runs every combination.

---

# Evaluation Metrics

Each experiment calculates four main evaluation metrics.

## Accuracy

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified samples.

```text
Accuracy =
Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
```

---

## Precision

Precision measures how many samples predicted as a particular class actually belong to that class.

---

## Recall

Recall measures how many samples belonging to a particular class were correctly identified.

---

## F1 Score

F1-score combines precision and recall:

```text
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall)
     --------------------------
       Precision + Recall
```

The project uses **weighted averaging** for precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

# Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is generated for every experiment.

It shows the relationship between:

```text
Actual Class
     ↓
Predicted Class
```

The confusion matrix helps identify which network traffic classes are correctly or incorrectly classified.

---

# Output Files

All experiment results are stored in:

```text
75_ML_Results/
```

Each experiment generates one JPG report.

Example:

```text
01_CatBoost_Test_20_PCA_2.jpg
02_AdaBoost_Test_20_PCA_2.jpg
03_KNearest_Neighbors_Test_20_PCA_2.jpg
04_Naive_Bayes_Test_20_PCA_2.jpg
05_Support_Vector_Machine_Test_20_PCA_2.jpg
```

Each JPG report contains:

1. Confusion matrix
2. Algorithm name
3. Test size
4. PCA components
5. Accuracy
6. Precision
7. Recall
8. F1-score
9. Classification report

---

# CSV Results

The program generates:

```text
ALL_75_RESULTS.csv
```

This file contains the metrics from all 75 experiments.

Example columns:

```text

```

The CSV can be further analyzed using:

# Important Note About the Results

The experiment uses a **stratified sample of up to 20,000 rows** from the combined dataset to make the 75-experiment workflow computationally manageable.

Therefore, the results represent model performance on this experimental sample and should not automatically be interpreted as performance on the entire original dataset.

The random state is fixed:

```python
RANDOM_STATE = 0
```

This makes the sampling and train-test splits reproducible.
